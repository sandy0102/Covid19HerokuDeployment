    <p class="text1"> Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused 
        by a newly discovered coronavirus.  Corona viruses are a large family of 
        viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several 
        coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the 
        common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
        and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently
        discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. </p>
    <p class="text1"> The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through 
        droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These 
        droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.
        You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity 
        of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your 
        eyes, nose or mouth. That's why people are advised to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) 
        away from everyone. </p>

    <p class="text"> The cases in Maharashtra are high in both recovery and deaths. It indicates that either there was a delay in testing for COVID-19 due to which cases could not be controlled or there have been other comorbidities attached with the patients.  Kerala has lower deaths and higher recovery which means it has shown good record in controlling the cases and has provided good medical healthcare support. States with lesser number of both recovery and deaths are having cases only in recent times and evaluation after a few days will be able to clear the air about their condition. </p>

    <p class="text">It is important to have a look at the demographic information of the population affected by COVID19 so that the target population can be identified. Contrary to other countries, the number of cases below 40 years of are considerbaly higher. Which means that youngsters are equally susceptible to the virus. This can be explained by demography of India which a young nation and most population is below 40 years of age.</p>
